# Machine Learning Practice

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Practice** repository! This project contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and datasets where I explore various Machine Learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and predictive modeling tasks.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following key projects and concepts:

### 🏠 Regression Projects
* **`canada_price_predictor.ipynb`**
    * A model designed to predict prices (likely per capita income or housing prices) in Canada based on historical data.
* **`carprice.ipynb`**
    * A machine learning model to estimate the price of cars based on various features (e.g., age, mileage, model).

### 🚢 Classification Projects
* **`titanic_survivor.ipynb`**
    * A solution to the classic Titanic ML challenge.
    * **Goal:** Predict whether a passenger survived based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare.
    * **Dataset:** Includes `titanic.csv` for training and analysis.
* **`logistic_regression.ipynb`**
    * A dedicated notebook exploring the implementation and intuition behind Logistic Regression for binary classification tasks.

### 🛠️ Core Concepts & Utilities
* **`train_test_split.ipynb`**
    * A demonstration of how to properly split datasets into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance and avoid overfitting.
* **`studying/`**
    * Contains additional resources and study materials.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run these notebooks locally, you will need Python installed along with Jupyter Notebook and common data science libraries.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Shawnpeter578/practise_ML.git](https://github.com/Shawnpeter578/practise_ML.git)
    cd practise_ML
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies (if not already installed):**
